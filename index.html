    <h1>The is my website about Draco Malfoy.</p>
    <h2>Draco Malfoy is a student at Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry. His parents are Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy. He has no siblings. His father was a Death Eater because of the Dark Lord.</h1>
<br>
    <h3>Of course like everyone he had heard stories about the boy who lived, Harry Potter. In his first year, he had asked him to be his friend but Draco hated him ever since he thought Weasley was better than him.</h2>
<br>
    <h4> He was not a bad person. He just hated Harry because he was never friends with him. In his second year, he told his Slytherin Gang, Crabbe and Goyle that Harry was the heir of Slytherin. But also Harry kept thinking that Malfoy was the heir of Slytherin but that was not true. Everyone found out that Lord Voldemort aka Tom Riddle was the Heir.</h3>
